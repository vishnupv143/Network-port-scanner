A Network Port Scanner that reads from a file is a tool designed to automate the process of scanning network ports based on input data provided in a file. The file typically contains a list of target IP addresses, domain names, or specific port numbers to scan. This scanner will analyze the connectivity and availability of services running on different ports, helping network administrators and security professionals assess potential vulnerabilities.
